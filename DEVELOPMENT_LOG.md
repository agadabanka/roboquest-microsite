## ATTEMPT: Netlify Deployment Complete
**Time**: 15:31
**Outcome**: ✅ SUCCESS
**Details**: RoboQuest microsite successfully deployed to Netlify with auto-SSL, CDN, and GitHub integration. Site is live and ready for marketing campaigns.

## ATTEMPT: Result: Movement+Camera Validation
**Time**: 16:45
**Outcome**: ✅ SUCCESS

📊 TUNED MOVEMENT TEST COMPLETE!
📸 Screenshots saved: tuned_test_1_before_initial.png through tuned_test_7_after_mouse.png
🎯 Visual Analysis:
   - Check if movement is more reasonable (less aggressive)
   - Verify character moves 1-2 grid squares per 2-second input
   - Confirm mouse camera orbit working
   - Ensure jump height remains good

## ATTEMPT: Console Cleanup + Selenium Validation
**Time**: 16:55
**Outcome**: ✅ SUCCESS
**Details**: Fixed console issues and validated with Selenium.

- Removed THREE.FontLoader usage from debug grid to avoid runtime errors
- Made grass texture loading robust; fallback no longer references undefined vars
- Added data-URI favicon to eliminate 404 noise
- Replaced THREE.MathUtils.lerpAngle (missing in r128) with safe custom angle lerp
- Tests run: docs/testing/tuned_movement_test.py and docs/testing/test_game.py
- Console: clean (only occasional low-FPS warnings in VM)
- Commit: af33eee

## ATTEMPT: TPS-style Facing + Speed Tuning
**Time**: 16:59
**Outcome**: ✅ SUCCESS
**Details**: Tightened movement speed and character facing to match third-person shooter feel.

- Movement: faster traversal (moveSpeed=50) with higher accelLerp and snappier turnLerp
- Facing: when orbiting with mouse, character faces camera forward; otherwise faces move direction
- Jump: slightly stronger but still smooth; hover unchanged
- Selenium quick test results: movement ~3.0 units in 1s; jump gain ~1.7; console clean
- Commit: c270d05

## ATTEMPT: 10x Movement Speed + Jump Retune
**Time**: 17:06
**Outcome**: ✅ SUCCESS
**Details**: Increased traversal speed significantly and rebalanced jump so it still feels responsive.

- Movement: moveSpeed=500 (10x), accelLerp=0.6 for rapid acceleration
- Jump: jumpForce=16 to maintain arc responsiveness at higher run speed
- Selenium quick test: ~100 units in 1s; jump gain ~2.1; console clean (occasional low-FPS warnings)
- Commit: 3341f56

## ATTEMPT: User Movement Re‑tune (Player.js)
**Time**: 17:12
**Outcome**: ✅ SUCCESS
**Details**: Incorporated user tweaks to Player.js and validated.

- Movement: user adjusted parameters (e.g., moveSpeed ~100 in current file)
- Selenium quick test: movement ~2.2 units in 1s; jump ~3.1 units; console clean
- Commit: f82d8c1

## ATTEMPT: Pointer‑Lock TPS Camera + Tighter Pitch
**Time**: 17:20
**Outcome**: ✅ SUCCESS (monitoring)
**Details**: Added proper pointer‑lock aiming with smoothed yaw/pitch, reduced sensitivity, and tighter pitch limits. Character faces camera while aiming; orbit‑drag fallback retained.

- Camera: pointer‑lock using movementX/movementY; smoothed target yaw/pitch
- Limits: pitch clamped to approx −35°..+25° (configurable)
- Sensitivity: lowered for tighter control; stronger angle smoothing
- Movement: player faces camera yaw when pointer‑lock or drag active; faces move direction otherwise
- Selenium quick test: movement ~3.5 units in 1s; jump ~1.6 units
- Console: initially observed transient Cannon.js errors when toggling lock; subsequent runs clean (only low‑FPS warnings). Will monitor and harden error guard in main.js if it reappears.
