📊 TUNED MOVEMENT TEST COMPLETE!
📸 Screenshots saved: tuned_test_1_before_initial.png through tuned_test_7_after_mouse.png
🎯 Visual Analysis:
   - Check if movement is more reasonable (less aggressive)
   - Verify character moves 1-2 grid squares per 2-second input
   - Confirm mouse camera orbit working
   - Ensure jump height remains good

## ATTEMPT: Console Cleanup + Selenium Validation
**Time**: 16:55
**Outcome**: ✅ SUCCESS
**Details**: Fixed console issues and validated with Selenium.

- Removed THREE.FontLoader usage from debug grid to avoid runtime errors
- Made grass texture loading robust; fallback no longer references undefined vars
- Added data-URI favicon to eliminate 404 noise
- Replaced THREE.MathUtils.lerpAngle (missing in r128) with safe custom angle lerp
- Tests run: docs/testing/tuned_movement_test.py and docs/testing/test_game.py
- Console: clean (only occasional low-FPS warnings in VM)
- Commit: af33eee

## ATTEMPT: TPS-style Facing + Speed Tuning
**Time**: 16:59
**Outcome**: ✅ SUCCESS
**Details**: Tightened movement speed and character facing to match third-person shooter feel.

- Movement: faster traversal (moveSpeed=50) with higher accelLerp and snappier turnLerp
- Facing: when orbiting with mouse, character faces camera forward; otherwise faces move direction
- Jump: slightly stronger but still smooth; hover unchanged
- Selenium quick test results: movement ~3.0 units in 1s; jump gain ~1.7; console clean
- Commit: c270d05
