📊 TUNED MOVEMENT TEST COMPLETE!
📸 Screenshots saved: tuned_test_1_before_initial.png through tuned_test_7_after_mouse.png
🎯 Visual Analysis:
   - Check if movement is more reasonable (less aggressive)
   - Verify character moves 1-2 grid squares per 2-second input
   - Confirm mouse camera orbit working
   - Ensure jump height remains good

## ATTEMPT: Console Cleanup + Selenium Validation
**Time**: 16:55
**Outcome**: ✅ SUCCESS
**Details**: Fixed console issues and validated with Selenium.

- Removed THREE.FontLoader usage from debug grid to avoid runtime errors
- Made grass texture loading robust; fallback no longer references undefined vars
- Added data-URI favicon to eliminate 404 noise
- Replaced THREE.MathUtils.lerpAngle (missing in r128) with safe custom angle lerp
- Tests run: docs/testing/tuned_movement_test.py and docs/testing/test_game.py
- Console: clean (only occasional low-FPS warnings in VM)
- Commit: af33eee

## ATTEMPT: TPS-style Facing + Speed Tuning
**Time**: 16:59
**Outcome**: ✅ SUCCESS
**Details**: Tightened movement speed and character facing to match third-person shooter feel.

- Movement: faster traversal (moveSpeed=50) with higher accelLerp and snappier turnLerp
- Facing: when orbiting with mouse, character faces camera forward; otherwise faces move direction
- Jump: slightly stronger but still smooth; hover unchanged
- Selenium quick test results: movement ~3.0 units in 1s; jump gain ~1.7; console clean
- Commit: c270d05

## ATTEMPT: 10x Movement Speed + Jump Retune
**Time**: 17:06
**Outcome**: ✅ SUCCESS
**Details**: Increased traversal speed significantly and rebalanced jump so it still feels responsive.

- Movement: moveSpeed=500 (10x), accelLerp=0.6 for rapid acceleration
- Jump: jumpForce=16 to maintain arc responsiveness at higher run speed
- Selenium quick test: ~100 units in 1s; jump gain ~2.1; console clean (occasional low-FPS warnings)
- Commit: 3341f56

## ATTEMPT: User Movement Re‑tune (Player.js)
**Time**: 17:12
**Outcome**: ✅ SUCCESS
**Details**: Incorporated user tweaks to Player.js and validated.

- Movement: user adjusted parameters (e.g., moveSpeed ~100 in current file)
- Selenium quick test: movement ~2.2 units in 1s; jump ~3.1 units; console clean
- Commit: f82d8c1

## ATTEMPT: Pointer‑Lock TPS Camera + Tighter Pitch
**Time**: 17:20
**Outcome**: ✅ SUCCESS (monitoring)
**Details**: Added proper pointer‑lock aiming with smoothed yaw/pitch, reduced sensitivity, and tighter pitch limits. Character faces camera while aiming; orbit‑drag fallback retained.

- Camera: pointer‑lock using movementX/movementY; smoothed target yaw/pitch
- Limits: pitch clamped to approx −35°..+25° (configurable)
- Sensitivity: lowered for tighter control; stronger angle smoothing
- Movement: player faces camera yaw when pointer‑lock or drag active; faces move direction otherwise
- Selenium quick test: movement ~3.5 units in 1s; jump ~1.6 units
- Console: initially observed transient Cannon.js errors when toggling lock; subsequent runs clean (only low‑FPS warnings). Will monitor and harden error guard in main.js if it reappears.

## ATTEMPT: Behind‑Character Follow + Character‑Relative Movement
**Time**: 17:35
**Outcome**: ✅ SUCCESS
**Details**: Locked camera behind character yaw (jetpack side) and made WASD relative to character orientation. Mouse aim turns character; camera adheres behind in a circle.

- Camera: followBehindTarget enabled; yaw uses character rotation; shortest‑path smoothing and yaw/pitch caps remain
- Movement: basis from character yaw (not camera); W moves forward of character, A/D strafe
- Direction cue: cyan arrow above robot shows heading/aim
- Selenium quick test: movement ~7.7 units in 1s; jump ~1.6; console clean (VM low‑FPS warnings only)
- Commit: 4fa299f (+ movement basis fix)

## ATTEMPT: OrbitControls Integration + Telemetry
**Time**: 17:42  
**Outcome**: ✅ PARTIAL  
**Details**: Integrated examples OrbitControls for robust orbit damping and added window telemetry for tests (`__camDebug`, `__playerDebug`). Helped stabilize orbit but strict camera-behind checks needed tolerance due to damping.  
**Key Learnings**:
- Use damping-aware thresholds (avg over 300–500ms) rather than per-frame assertions
- Keep a single authority for character yaw to avoid double-writes (Player vs Camera)
- Add null-safe error logging in `main.js` to avoid noisy console traces

## ATTEMPT: Egloff-Style Rig (Yaw/Pitch Pivots)
**Time**: 17:55  
**Outcome**: ✅ SUCCESS  
**Details**: Implemented Egloff TPS rig with yaw and pitch pivots, pointer-lock look, and drag-to-look fallback. Camera is behind character; character yaw follows aim each frame.  
**Notes**:
- Added rig to scene for proper world transforms
- Tight pitch clamp and capped per-frame angle deltas prevent oscillation
- A/B switch via `?controller=egloff` (now default, legacy via `?controller=legacy`)
- Test: 20s TPS integration — yaw issues: 0, behind issues: 0, console: 0
- Commits: abe8562, a090201

## ATTEMPT: Aim-Driven Movement (No Strafe)
**Time**: 18:05  
**Outcome**: ✅ SUCCESS  
**Details**: Movement vector now derives from camera forward on XZ; W moves toward aim, S moves backward; A/D ignored as requested; arrow shows motion direction or aim when idle.  
**Commits**: b50041e

## ATTEMPT: Character Rotation Validation
**Time**: 18:10  
**Outcome**: ✅ SUCCESS  
**Details**: Added `test_character_rotation.py` to assert that mouse movement rotates the player mesh (without clicks). Saves before/after screenshots and reports yaw deltas.  
**Result**: Δ1≈0.18 rad, Δ2≈0.09 rad; console clean  
**Commit**: dbc7441

## ATTEMPT: Facing Responsiveness Boost
**Time**: 18:14  
**Outcome**: ✅ SUCCESS  
**Details**: Increased character facing lerp and snap on large yaw deltas to keep up with mouse flicks; removed lag behind camera yaw.  
**Commit**: 67fe50e

## RELEASE: Playable Version 2
**Time**: 18:18  
**Outcome**: 🏁 TAGGED  
**Details**: Egloff camera default, aim-driven movement, `D` key mapped to jump alongside Space.
